# Thought Process

### Question 1: "What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?"

**Thought Process:**
1. Understanding the goal: The question aims to determine the total amount spent by each customer at the restaurant. This indicates the need to calculate the sum of the prices for all the items purchased by each customer.
2. Identifying the relevant tables: To calculate the total amount spent, I need to consider the sales data, which likely contains information about the customer ID and the product ID associated with each sale. Additionally, I need access to the menu table, which contains the price information for each item.
3. Utilizing aggregate functions: The mention of the "total amount" indicates that I need to calculate the sum of the prices. This implies the use of an aggregate function like SUM() to add up the prices for each customer.
4. Grouping the data: Since I am calculating the total amount for each customer, I need to group the data by the customer ID. Any time an aggregate function is used in the SELECT statement, I need to include a corresponding GROUP BY clause to define the grouping criteria.
5. Joining the tables: In order to access the price information for each product, I need to join the sales table with the menu table. By linking the product IDs in both tables, I can retrieve the relevant price information.
6. Ordering the results: Finally, since the question asks for the total amount spent by each customer, I can order the results by the customer ID to display the information in a systematic manner.

By following this thought process, I can construct the SQL query that calculates the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant, grouping the results by customer ID and ordering them accordingly.

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(m.price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

This query will provide the desired result for the total amount spent by each customer, ordered by customer ID.

### Question 2: "How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?"

**Thought Process:**
1. Understanding the goal: The question aims to determine the number of days each customer has visited the restaurant. This suggests that we need to count the unique occurrences of order dates for each customer.
2. Identifying the relevant table: Since we are interested in tracking the customer visits, we can focus on the sales data, which likely contains information about the customer ID and the order dates.
3. Utilizing aggregate functions: To count the number of days visited, we can use the COUNT() function. This function counts the occurrences of a particular column, in this case, the order dates.
4. Grouping the data: Since we want to calculate the count for each customer, we need to group the data by the customer ID. The GROUP BY clause allows us to group the data accordingly.
5. Ordering the results: Finally, to display the information in a systematic manner, we can order the results by the customer ID.

By following this thought process, we can construct the SQL query that calculates the number of days each customer has visited the restaurant, grouping the results by customer ID and ordering them accordingly.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS num_days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

This query will provide the desired result for the number of days each customer has visited the restaurant, ordered by customer ID.

### Question 3: "What

 was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?"

**Thought Process:**
1. Understanding the goal: The question aims to identify the first item purchased from the menu by each customer. This suggests that we need to determine the earliest order date for each customer and retrieve the corresponding menu item.
2. Identifying the relevant tables: To answer this question, we need to consider the sales data, which likely contains information about the customer ID, the product ID, and the order dates. Additionally, we require the menu table to access the product names.
3. Ranking the data: To identify the first item purchased by each customer, we can use the DENSE_RANK() function. By partitioning the data by the customer ID and ordering it by the order date, we assign a rank to each unique combination of customer and order date.
4. Selecting the relevant data: Since we are interested in the first item purchased by each customer, we need to filter the results based on the rank. In this case, we want to retrieve the rows where the rank is equal to 1.
5. Displaying the results: To present the information, we select all columns from the derived table (aliased as 'e') that contains the distinct customer ID, product name, order date, and rank.

By following this thought process, we can construct the SQL query that retrieves the first item from the menu purchased by each customer. The query uses a subquery to calculate the ranks and then filters the results to display the rows with a rank of 1.

```sql
SELECT e.*
FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT s.customer_id, m.product_name, s.order_date,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rnk
    FROM sales s
    LEFT JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id) e
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

This query will provide the desired result, showing the first item purchased from the menu by each customer, along with the order date.

### Question 4: "What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?"

**Thought Process:**
Part one: Finding the most purchased item
1. Understanding the goal: The first part of the question aims to identify the most purchased item on the menu. This suggests that we need to determine the item that has the highest number of purchases.
2. Identifying the relevant tables: To answer this question, we need to consider the sales data, which likely contains information about the product ID associated with each purchase. Additionally, we require the menu table to access the product names.
3. Counting the occurrences: By using the COUNT() function and grouping the data by the product name, we can calculate the number of times each item has been purchased.
4. Grouping and limiting the results: To find the most purchased item, we group the results by the product name and limit the output to only one row using the LIMIT clause.

By following this thought process, we can construct the SQL query that retrieves the most purchased item from the menu.

```sql
SELECT m.product_name, COUNT(m.product_name) AS most_purchased
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY most_purchased DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Part two: Counting the purchases of the most purchased item
1. Understanding the goal: The second part of the question aims to determine how many times the most purchased item was bought by all customers. We focus on the specific item identified in the first part.
2. Identifying the relevant tables: We still need to consider the sales data and the menu table to access the

 necessary information.
3. Filtering the data: To count the purchases of the most purchased item, we add a WHERE clause to specify the product name that we obtained in the first part.
4. Counting the occurrences and grouping the results: We use the COUNT() function again to calculate the number of times the item was purchased, and we group the results by the customer ID and product name to get a count per customer.
5. Ordering the results: Finally, we order the results by the customer ID to display the information in a systematic manner.

By following this thought process, we can construct the SQL query that counts the purchases of the most purchased item by all customers.

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, m.product_name, COUNT(m.product_name) AS times_purchased
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE m.product_name = 'ramen' -- Replace 'ramen' with the most purchased item obtained in the first part
GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

This query will provide the desired result, showing the customer ID, the most purchased item (specified in the WHERE clause), and the number of times that item was purchased by each customer, ordered by the customer ID.
